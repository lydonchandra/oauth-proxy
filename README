This is an OAuth proxy.  It allows vanilla requests to be funneled through it and signed
appropriately using OAuth.  For now, it only uses a single, pre-set access token.

To create an OAuth proxy server:
mktap oauth_proxy --consumer_key <consumer key> --consumer_secret <consumer secret> [--token <token>] [--token_secret <token secret>] [-p <proxy port>] [--ssl]

Start the generated tap (in the foreground):
twistd -nf oauth_proxy.tap

(For mktap to find oauth_proxy, you may need to make sure that "." is in your PYTHONPATH)
